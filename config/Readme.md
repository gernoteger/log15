# About 

Package config enables configuration of log15 from some arbitray maps. It does not read any config files. 
This is a deliberate design decitin in order to decouple reading of configs from the act of instantiating
Handlers and Loggers from the config.

# Usage
TODO: get from tests / create examples


# Add new Handlers

## Integrated as PR

## As  self-contained project
TODO: describe needed structs+ imports
